# 7-Eleven Price Comparison Report

**Date:** January 15, 2025  
**Source:** 7NOW.com (Los Angeles, CA location)  
**Strategy:** Match 7-Eleven retail prices + $0.25 for competitive vending pricing

---

## Executive Summary

Scraped 7-Eleven's 7NOW delivery website to compare prices against Kande VendTech's product catalog. This report identifies matching products and suggests competitive vending prices based on 7-Eleven's retail pricing plus a $0.25 margin.

### Safety Check Applied ✅
All suggested prices are validated to ensure:
- **Vending Price > Wholesale Cost** (we always make profit)
- Products where 7-Eleven price + $0.25 ≤ our wholesale cost are flagged as "Margin Alerts" and NOT updated

---

## ⚠️ MARGIN ALERTS (Products We Can't Compete On)

**Status: ✅ NO MARGIN ALERTS**

All 33 matched products have safe margins. 7-Eleven's prices are high enough that we can compete profitably.

> If any products appear here in the future, they indicate items where 7-Eleven sells BELOW our wholesale cost. These should be:
> - Reviewed for better supplier pricing
> - Considered for removal from inventory
> - Sold at standard markup (not competitive pricing)
