## 1. Executive Summary

**The business in a nutshell:** Vending is a foot-traffic game with predictable, recurring revenue once machines are placed in qualified locations. The operators who scale fastest treat every location like a real estate investment, sell relentlessly, and hire before they think they're ready.

- **Target 60–65% gross margin** on ambient products, accept 45–50% on frozen. Price to gas-station parity or slightly above — never Walmart.
- **Class A luxury apartments (200+ units)** and **medical outpatient facilities (150+ staff + 100+ daily patients)** are the two highest-performing location types. Mailroom/package-room placement beats everything else in residential.
- **Sales cycle is long** — 10–12 weeks average, sometimes 6–8 months. 1-in-10 pop-in conversion rate. Never stop prospecting.
- **The $54 rent premium pitch** is your closer for property managers: vending/convenience amenities equate to $54/unit in premium rent.
- **Finance machines, conserve cash** for hiring, inventory, and warehouse. 0% APR business credit cards are the community's go-to.
- **Hire stockers early.** The opportunity cost of missed pop-ins because you're restocking far exceeds a stocker's wage. Always have 2+ part-timers for redundancy.
- **Micro-markets outperform smart coolers by 50–100%** in revenue. Favor open-market format where the location allows it.
- **Revenue is predictable after ~5 months** — plus or minus 5% each month (Anthony). Weekly payouts from vending processors give solid cash flow.
- **Best-performing operators** hit **$35K–$102K/month** within 18–24 months. Shannon's single micro-market location does **$22K–$25K/month**.

## 2. Pricing Strategy

### Core Rules

| Rule | Target | Source |
|------|--------|--------|
| Minimum gross margin per item | **50%** | Kyle Davey |
| Target margin — ambient products | **60–65%** | Anthony, Lane Folkers |
| Target margin — frozen items | **45–50%** | Anthony |
| Target overall margin | **~60%** | Lane Folkers |
| Rule-of-thumb markup | **3× cost** (except when COGS > $2) | Jason Carlin |
| Net margin after fees, labor, overhead | **30–35%** | Skool community consensus |

### Pricing Psychology & Tactics

- **Start higher, adjust down** — underpricing is harder to recover from (Jason Carlin)
- **Use psychological pricing** — $3.95 not $4.00, $2.49 not $2.50 (Ben Miller)
- **Cluster pricing by category** — all chips at one price, all energy drinks at one price. Simplifies customer experience (Kyle Davey)
- **Price to gas-station parity or slightly above** — that's the benchmark, NOT Walmart (Lane Folkers)
- **Smart stores often don't show shelf prices** — customers see price at POS, reducing sensitivity (Lane Folkers)
- **Apartments tolerate higher pricing** due to the convenience factor — especially luxury
- **White-collar offices are more price-sensitive** — surveys show complaints about pricing "42% higher than Walmart." Consider offering cheaper cans alongside premium bottles at these sites
- **Prioritize profit per unit over margin percentage** — a $5 item at 40% margin = $2 profit beats a $2 item at 60% = $1.20 (Anthony)
- **Evaluate freezer performance at the freezer level**, not by individual item (Skool Weekly Call)

### Category-Specific Pricing

| Category | COGS | Retail | Margin | Notes |
|----------|------|--------|--------|-------|
| Energy drinks (Red Bull 8.4oz) | ~$2.00 | $3.75–3.99 | ~47–50% | Highest velocity category |
| Energy drinks (Red Bull 12oz) | ~$2.50 | $4.99 | ~50% | |
| Chips/snacks | ~$0.60–1.00 | $2.49 | ~60–75% | |
| Regular candy | ~$0.50–0.75 | $1.75–2.00 | ~60–70% | |
| King-size candy | ~$1.25 | $3.39 | ~63% | |
| Cans of soda | $0.36 | $1.00–2.00 | ~64–82% | Buy on sale, load up for 3 months |
| Ramen | ~$0.30–0.50 | $1.50–2.00 | ~70%+ | Sells exceptionally well |
| Pop-Tarts | ~$0.50 | $1.75–2.00 | ~65–70% | High-margin and popular |
| Core Water | $0.93 | $2.99 | ~69% | "Highest velocity seller" — $1.70 net/bottle after fees |
| Fair Life Core Power 42g protein | ~$3.50 | $7.99 | ~56% | "Flying off shelves — meal replacement" |
| Sandwiches (Costco) | $3.84–5.00 | $7.00–8.25 | ~40–55% | Higher absolute profit |
| Salads | $3.00 | $7.65 | ~61% | $4.65 profit per salad |
| Toilet paper (Charmin 6-pack) | ~$8.00 | $16.99 | ~50%+ | Shannon sells 2–3/week |

### Bottles vs. Cans

- **Prefer bottles over cans** — higher dollar profit per unit (Lane Folkers)
- 16.9oz bottles preferred for margin and shelf life; transition to 20oz when feasible
- In some markets, operators price cans = bottles (e.g., $4 in LA)
- Cans still needed in price-sensitive markets — use as "relationship sacrifices"

### Revenue Share Models

| Model | Range | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| No rev share | **$0** | Push for this when possible |
| Flat monthly | **$25/month** | Simplest approach |
| Percentage of gross | **3–5%** | Most common |
| Tiered/sliding | Tied to monthly volume | **Recommended** — protects you when sales are weak |

## 3. Location Strategy

### Top Location Types (Ranked by Performance)

#### 1. High-Rise Apartment Towers (Downtown, with Airbnb units)
- **Expected revenue:** $6K–7K/month (open market format)
- **Why:** Airbnb guest traffic is a massive bonus; forced foot traffic through lobbies
- **Shannon's unicorn:** High-rise apartments + condos + long-term hotel combo in Seattle = **$22K–$25K/month** from a single micro-market

#### 2. Class A Luxury Apartments
- **Minimum threshold:** **200+ units**
- **Expected revenue:** $2,195+/month per Stockwell machine (first-month case study, Houston); higher with open-market format
- **Revenue per apartment unit:** **$8–10/month**
- **Why they crush it:** 24/7 access, residents have disposable income, not price-conscious. Residents won't walk 2–3 blocks to a convenience store at 11:30 PM — they'll take the elevator
- **Leasing advantage:** Property managers love it as a tour amenity
- **The $54 stat:** Having vending/convenience inside a building equates to **$54/unit in premium rent**
- **Critical rule:** **Single building ONLY. Garden-style apartments are a HARD PASS** (unless mailroom placement works)
- **Scaling hack:** The property management company usually manages OTHER properties — one relationship can unlock multiple locations
- **Enter early at new developments** — even at 0% occupancy. Long-term relationship advantage

#### 3. Medical Outpatient Facilities
- **Minimum threshold:** **150 employees + 100 patients daily** (250+ total foot traffic)
- **Why Anthony loves these:** "I wish I could add more of these to my portfolio"
  - Doctors/nurses work 12-hour shifts, grab Fair Life protein ($7.99) as meal replacements
  - High-income staff = not price-conscious
  - Patients waiting 30–45 min buy impulsively
  - **Recession-proof** — people always need to see doctors
  - High-stress environment → impulsive buying
- **Pro tip:** Ask if the facility uses **Placer AI** — one facility sent Anthony 3 years of foot traffic data (400 patients/day M–F)

#### 4. Multi-Shift Warehouse/Manufacturing Facilities
- **Minimum threshold:** **150 employees**
- **Expected revenue:** **$10K+/month** (but competitive market)
- **Why:** Captive audience, limited nearby food options, short 15-min breaks = workers can't leave
- **Best format:** Micro-market in employee break room
- **Qualifying questions:**
  - "How stable is the company? Are you growing?"
  - "How many employees per shift?" (Don't assume — Anthony once assumed 75 on 2nd shift when it was 3)
  - "Are you opening new divisions or hiring?"

#### 5. Large Office Buildings
- **Minimum threshold:** **200+ employees**
- **Note:** White-collar sites are more price-sensitive — may need to offer cheaper can options alongside premium bottles

#### 6. Student Housing
- **High volume** but watch for theft — requires secure equipment

### Placement Within the Building

> "If you place it in the wrong part of the building, it could decrease your sales by 25%." — Anthony

**Best placements (ranked):**
1. **Mailroom / package room** — consistently strongest performer in residential
2. **Elevator lobbies** — forced foot traffic
3. **Building lobby / amenity lounge** — high visibility
4. **Break rooms** (offices/industrial) — captive audience

**Avoid:**
- Fitness centers — consistently underperform
- Pool areas — consistently underperform
- Time-restricted common rooms — hours kill sales
- Anywhere visible from the street — invites vandalism (Kyle Davey)

**Always ask the property manager:** "Where's the most foot traffic in the building?" They know where people congregate. Push back diplomatically if they suggest a suboptimal spot.

### Location Red Flags 🚩

- **Convenience store within a couple blocks** — kills your traffic
- **Placing machines for YOUR convenience** — Anthony put a machine 5 min from his house; it only did $700–800/month
- **Not asking about shift sizes** — always get numbers per shift
- **Garden-style apartments** — hard pass (limited traffic, theft risk)
- **Locations too far from your hub** — Shannon keeps a **10–15 mile radius max**; turned down a 69-mile opportunity
- **Under 150 employees** (industrial) or **under 200 units** (residential)
- **Free snack programs** — ask: "Do you supply snacks for free?" If yes, that undercuts your machine
- **Government contracts with heavy rev share + insurance requirements** — one operator got only $700/month with 15% rev share
- **89-unit properties** — one case study showed only $97 first week despite "good lobby location"

### Location Evaluation Checklist

- [ ] Unit count / employee count meets minimums (200+ res, 150+ industrial)
- [ ] Occupancy rate (>90% ideal)
- [ ] 24/7 access confirmed
- [ ] No convenience store within 2–3 blocks
- [ ] No free snack program
- [ ] Best placement spot available (mailroom, lobby, break room)
- [ ] Within 15-mile service radius
- [ ] Company is stable/growing (industrial)
- [ ] Property manager is receptive + manages other properties
- [ ] Not visible from the street

### Equipment by Location Type

| Location Type | Recommended Equipment | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Premium high-rise | Stockwell (365) | Reliable, secure, higher fees |
| Large property (200+) | PicoVision combo | Better capacity |
| Standard apartment | Haha Pro | Cost-effective |
| Micro-market format | Moneta kiosk | Best service, lower fees than 365 |
| Open market | Cantaloupe (swap kiosk for Moneta) | Reduce fees |
| High-security needed | Traditional machines | Only where location requires protection |

**Key insight from Anthony:** AI smart coolers are far superior to traditional machines — "90% of issues can be troubleshot remotely." Traditional machines are a "pain in the butt — coils, cash box, coin dispenser, so many things can go wrong." Use traditional only where location demands it.

**Micro-markets consistently outperform** traditional vending and smart coolers, often **50–100% more revenue** in the same location.

## 4. Sales & Pop-in Strategy

### The Pitch

> "Vending machines is by far the easiest sales job I've ever had. There's almost no objections." — Kyle ($40K/month)

**Core pitch elements:**

1. **Frame it as an amenity, not a vendor placement** — "You're providing an amenity to the building." Leasing agents use it to show potential tenants
2. **Drop the $54 stat** — "A study showed having convenience inside a building equates to $54/unit in premium rent. On a 250-unit building, that's $13,500/year in additional NOI for the owner"
3. **Use the distributor advantage** — When property managers ask "You're not just buying from Costco, right?" → "I got a distributor with 5,000 SKUs. You want Starbucks, all gummies, spicy Gardetto Italian trail mix — you got it." (This closed deals against competitors who only had variety packs — Anthony)
4. **Don't use "vending" language** — Position as "smart market" or "AI-powered convenience" to improve perception
5. **Ask for referrals every time** — "What other properties do you manage? Do you know other people?" Property managers are all friends; it's a small industry. Anthony gets 1–2 referrals/month just from reputation now

### Pop-in Cadence

- **Kyle's approach:** Pop-ins 1–2× per week when actively growing
- **Anthony's approach:** **15–20 pop-ins in a single day** (batch on a Saturday or flexible weekday)
- **Conversion rate:** Roughly **1 in 10** (sometimes 3 in 10, sometimes 0 in 20 — "law of averages, it always averages out")
- **Never stop pop-ins** — even after landing first locations. "Stopped doing pop-ins after landing first location — big mistake. Momentum matters!" (Thomas Rohlader)

### Sales Cycle

> "It's the longest sales cycle I've ever had. Sometimes it takes 10–12 weeks or even longer. 6, 7, 8 months I've been chasing some leads." — Kyle

- **Average:** ~10–12 weeks from first contact to placement
- **Range:** Same week (unicorn) to 8+ months
- **Typical:** ~3 months to close a location (Skool consensus)
- **Key insight for Kande's 91 prospects:** Don't give up. Kyle's explosive Q2 was just old leads finally saying yes — "all these yeses just kind of started trickling in for leads I'd been talking to for months"
- **Follow-up is everything.** Use a CRM religiously — "Have a CRM so you don't lose track of your leads" (Kyle)

### Qualifying Questions (During Pop-ins)

- Where's the most foot traffic in the building?
- How many units / employees? (Get specific per shift)
- Do you supply snacks for free?
- What are your business hours? 24/7 access?
- Is the company growing / hiring?
- Is it near the package room or amenity lounge?
- Do you manage other properties?
- Is there a convenience store within a few blocks?

### Mindset on Rejection

> "For every door I knocked on trying to sell a newspaper subscription, I was probably 1 for 50. But when I got that one, I made 150 bucks as a 14-year-old." — Kyle

- In baseball, you strike out 7/10 times and still make the All-Star game
- Don't get discouraged by individual rejections — results come in waves
- "If you're not out there hustling to get it, somebody else is going to." — Kyle
- When a competitor sent Kyle a cease-and-desist letter to bully him out, his response: "Let's go. Game on, buddy." He went harder.

## 5. Operations

### Restocking Frequency

| Location Type | Frequency | Example |
|--------------|-----------|---------|
| Unicorn / high-volume | 3–4× per week | Shannon's $25K location: Mon, Wed, Fri + Sat/Sun |
| Open market (tower) | 2–3× per week | Skool benchmarks |
| Standard / moderate | Every 3–4 days | Community consensus |
| Low-volume | 1× per week | Small offices |

**Critical lesson:** Shannon's first location sold out in **48 hours** — be prepared to adjust cadence fast.

### Inventory Management

- **Early stage (1–5 machines):** You can eyeball it
- **At scale (15–25+ machines):** You MUST systemize
  - Create scheduled sales analysis per machine
  - Track what's selling vs. sitting
  - Restock BEFORE machines run low — use software to track stockouts
  - Kyle: "I walked into the warehouse and the Coke rack was full. After one day of restocking, almost empty. I had to systemize."
- **Align delivery days** from different vendors when possible
- **Use insulated containers** (Cambro boxes) for temperature-sensitive products

### The Variety Pack Problem

> "I would order Gatorade Zero and it would come in a variety pack — fruit punch, glacier cherry, lemon lime. Lemon lime sells 3× more." — Anthony

- **Effective cost per unit with variety packs is 50+ cents HIGHER** due to waste/oversupply of unpopular flavors
- **Solution:** Use distributor relationships to order single-SKU cases
- This applies to ANY variety pack from Costco/Sam's

### Sourcing Strategy

| Supplier | Best For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Sam's Club** | Beverages, bulk items | Far cheaper than VendHub for most drinks |
| **Costco Business Center** | Sandwiches, variety, single-SKU | Ham/turkey sandwiches $3.84 → $8.25 retail |
| **Vistar** | Variety, bulk, rebates | $750 min order to avoid shipping |
| **Walmart** | Fill-in items, bagged candy | Pick-up ordering convenient |
| **VendHub** | Hard-to-source SKUs, quality fresh | Better quality wraps/sandwiches than Walmart |
| **Distributors (general)** | Single-SKU cases, rebates, delivery | **Rebate checks: 3–12%** quarterly. Competitive advantage in pitches |

**Critical:** **Register as a reseller immediately** at Costco/Sam's to avoid paying sales tax — "no way to claw back sales tax after paying" (Thomas Rohlader)

**Pro tip:** Buy cans of soda on sale and "load up for 3 months" (Michael Deese)

### Top-Selling Products (Community-Wide)

| Product | Price Point | Why It Works |
|---------|------------|--------------|
| **Smartwater 20oz** | — | Shannon's #1 seller ($6K/month in water alone at unicorn) |
| **Core Water** | $2.99 | "Highest velocity seller" — $1.70 net/bottle after fees |
| **Coke Zero 20oz** | — | Anthony's top seller across route |
| **Monster / Red Bull** | $3.75–4.99 | Highest velocity category overall |
| **Fair Life Core Power 42g protein** | $7.99 | "Flying off shelves — meal replacement" at medical/office sites |
| **Gatorade Zero Lemon Lime** | — | Sells 3× more than other Gatorade flavors |
| **Cheetos Flamin' Hot** | $2.49 | Top seller in Houston case study (38 units first month) |
| **Snickers** | $1.75–3.39 | Perennial top seller |
| **Skinny Pop White Cheddar 1oz** | — | Anthony hunted Dollar Trees for this before getting distributor access |
| **Ramen** | $1.50–2.00 | 70%+ margin, sells exceptionally well |
| **Pop-Tarts** | $1.75–2.00 | 65%+ margin, consistently popular |

### Non-Traditional / Convenience Items (Residential)

- **Toilet paper (Charmin 6-pack):** $16.99 sell, ~$8 cost = 50%+ margin. Shannon sells 2–3/week
- **Paper towels, laundry pods** — convenience items residents don't want to go out for
- **Advil, Excedrin, cough drops** — "Our incidentals actually do really well" (Shannon)
- **Condoms, shampoo, conditioner** — sell surprisingly well at apartments
- **Dog treats** — Anthony adding by customer request
- **Room-temperature water** — some customers specifically want this (Shannon added 40 bottles near checkout)

### Planogram Strategy

- **Do a thorough planogram with real product dimensions** before stocking
- Test-fit tall bottles — bottle heights reduce usable shelves
- Use chip/snack dividers with spring pressure for consistent fronting
- Start with generalized layouts, adjust based on local demand
- Focus on proven top sellers first (Coke, Diet Coke, Gatorade, Fairlife), then experiment
- **Healthy items:** Stock if required to close a deal, but monitor performance and rotate. Despite manager preferences, **top sellers remain energy drinks, candy, and frozen items**

### Software & Reporting

| Platform | Reporting | Payouts | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **365/Stockwell** | Robust "Sales Analysis" reporting | Weekly (Fridays) | "Bulletproof on payment capture" |
| **Haha** | merchant.hahavending.com exports | On-demand (2 free/month) | Device/product rankings with gross margin |
| **Moneta** | Good micro-market tools | Weekly (Wed/Thu) | Best service quality |
| **MicroMart** | Scheduling features | Varies | Smart cooler specific |
| **QuickBooks Solopreneur** | P&L tracking | — | Adequate and cheap for early stage |
| **VenSoft** | Multi-platform consolidation | — | For operators with mixed equipment |

### Connectivity

- **Dedicated routers > SIM cards** for stability
- Run speed tests pre-install
- **Haha router:** ~$15/month; remove SIM after confirming Wi-Fi
- **Cellular options:** WTI ($25/month), OptConnect ($45/month)
- Some enterprises prohibit third-party payment on their Wi-Fi — use cellular gateways

### Warehouse & Storage Progression

| Stage | Setup | When |
|-------|-------|------|
| Start | Living room / garage | Month 1–6 (Shannon ran 800 sq ft home for 6 months) |
| Growth | Storage unit with 24/7 access | 5–10 machines |
| Scale | Dedicated warehouse with receiving capability | 15+ machines |

**Key feature needed:** A place that can receive deliveries when you're not there is a game-changer (Kyle).

Kyle's turning point: Getting a warehouse in the city where his machines are (1 hour from home) and hiring a local stocker — "That was a game changer... now this really feels like a business."

## 6. Scaling Playbook

### Growth Milestones & Timeline

| Milestone | Timeline | Revenue | Operator |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------|
| First machine placed | Month 1 | $700–800 (bad) to $3K+ (good) | — |
| 2 machines at first location | Month 1–2 | Start small, scale based on performance | Skool guidance |
| 10 machines | ~6–8 months | ~$10K/month | General benchmark |
| 25–30 machines | ~21 months | $35–40K/month | Kyle |
| ~4–6 locations (micro-market) | ~18 months | $30K+/month | Shannon |
| 45 locations, 79 machines | ~24 months | $102K/month | Anthony |
| $42,500/month = ~$500K annual | ~18–24 months | $500K/year | Kyle approaching this |

### When to Hire (And Who)

**1. First Stocker — ASAP after you can't grow**
> "I could no longer do pop-ins and grow the business because I was too busy working IN the business." — Kyle

- **Craigslist** most effective platform — screen for vehicle capacity (fit 6+ bins)
- Word-of-mouth via social media also effective
- **Multiple part-timers > one full-timer** — Kyle learned after his only employee quit on the spot (dropped keys at the door). Now runs 2 part-timers (soon 3)
- "Show up and grind with your team" — best morale boost (Anthony)

**2. Warehouse Manager — At 15–25+ machines**
- Handles kitting, sales analysis, inventory management
- Kyle promoted a driver who preferred computer work
- The other driver just loads and goes — doesn't kit or analyze

**3. Ops Manager — At 40+ locations**
- Handles: ordering inventory, pop-ins, morning dispatch, sales reports, product optimization
- Training period: ~1–1.5 months working together
- Result: Anthony went from 8–10 hours/week to **2 hours/week** (just daily check-ins)

### Hiring Structure (Scaled Route)

```
Owner (you)
├── Ops Manager (ordering, reporting, pop-ins, dispatching)
├── Warehouse Manager (kitting, sales analysis, inventory)
└── Drivers/Stockers ×2-3 (load vehicle, restock, go)
```

### Financing Strategy

**Option 1: 0% APR Business Credit Cards** (Community favorite)
- Chase Ink Cash/Unlimited: $6K spend in 3 months, $900 bonus, 0% APR for 12 months
- Amex Blue Business Plus: $3K spend, lower bonus, easier approval
- **Stagger applications 30–90 days apart** to extend interest-free runway
- Operators funding ~$50K in equipment this way
- Track with spreadsheets + Travel Freely app
- **⚠️ Pay off before promo APR ends** — otherwise 18–25% kicks in

**Option 2: Equipment Financing**
- Monthly payments manageable with machine revenue
- Preserves cash for hiring, inventory, and warehouse

> "I made a mistake liquidating savings to pay cash for machines. I wish I would have financed those first machines and kept that cash for hiring a stocker or reinvesting." — Anthony

**Core principle:** **Finance machines, conserve cash for operations.** Don't give yourself a low-paying job by hoarding cash into machines instead of infrastructure.

### Route Efficiency

- Monitor revenue-to-labor ratios as you scale
- Benchmark: **$3,500 revenue for 8 labor hours + expenses**
- **Move underperforming machines before buying more** — one operator doubled revenue by relocating a micro-market to a different building on the same campus
- Keep service radius to **10–15 miles max** (Shannon's rule)

### Buying Existing Routes

- **Distressed routes:** 0.5×–1× annual revenue
- **Better-run setups:** Up to 2× annual revenue
- PE groups entering the market buying routes >$10M/year — "Supply & demand in an industry going through disruption is great for you guys"

## 8. Mistakes to Avoid

### Location Mistakes

1. **Placing machines for convenience, not traffic** — Anthony's $700/month machine was 5 min from his house. His $4K–5K machines are in properly qualified locations.
2. **Not asking enough qualifying questions** — Don't assume shift sizes (Anthony assumed 75 on 2nd shift, it was 3). Don't skip the free-snacks question. Don't forget to check for nearby convenience stores.
3. **Garden-style clubhouses** — Limited traffic, theft risk. Hard pass.
4. **Overcommitting on equipment before qualifying the location** — Do your homework first.
5. **89-unit property gamble** — One operator got only $97 first week at a "good lobby location" in a small building.
6. **Government contracts with heavy terms** — 15% rev share + insurance = only $700/month.
7. **Placing machines visible from the street** — Invites vandalism (Kyle Davey).
8. **Fitness centers and pool areas** — Consistently underperform. Push for better placement.
9. **Accepting suboptimal placement from property managers** — Push back diplomatically.

### Sales Mistakes

10. **Stopping pop-ins after first location** — "Momentum matters!" (Thomas Rohlader). Never stop prospecting.
11. **Getting discouraged by rejection** — It's a numbers game. 1 in 10 is normal. Results come in waves.
12. **Not using a CRM** — With 10–12 week+ sales cycles, you WILL lose leads without one.
13. **Not asking for referrals** — Every property manager knows other property managers. End every pop-in with: "Do you manage other properties?"
14. **Ignoring competition or letting it intimidate you** — When a competitor sent Kyle a cease-and-desist, he went harder.

### Pricing & Product Mistakes

15. **Underpricing** — Harder to raise prices than to start high. Always start at 3× cost or gas-station parity (Jason Carlin).
16. **Buying variety packs at scale** — Waste from unsold flavors makes effective cost 50+ cents higher per unit. Get distributor relationships for single-SKU ordering ASAP.
17. **Promising "all healthy" product mix** — Products won't move. Top sellers remain energy drinks, candy, and frozen items.
18. **Not registering as reseller** at Costco/Sam's — Paying unnecessary sales tax with no way to claw it back (Thomas Rohlader).

### Operations Mistakes

19. **Trying to do everything yourself too long** — "You can't do $25/hour tasks all the time." Hire before you think you're ready. The opportunity cost of missed pop-ins far exceeds a stocker's wage.
20. **Only having one employee** — When Kyle's only employee quit on the spot, everything fell apart. Always have 2+ part-timers for redundancy.
21. **Two stockers quit via text on stocking day** — Always have backup (Skool community).
22. **Not testing every item before opening** — Scan everything; SKUs change.
23. **Ignoring planogram dimensions** — Tall bottles waste vertical shelf space.
24. **SIM cards for connectivity** — Spotty. Use dedicated routers.
25. **Stockwell temperature lockout** — Machine went into lockout mode after install; no sales until manually fixed. Monitor new installs closely.
26. **Leaving damaged machines in bad neighborhoods** — "Bad guys probably aren't going to stop."

### Financial Mistakes

27. **Paying cash for machines instead of financing** — Conserve cash for operations, hiring, and inventory. Finance the machines — revenue covers payments (Anthony).
28. **Not paying off 0% APR cards before promo ends** — 18–25% interest kicks in.

### Fresh Food Mistakes

29. **Jumping into fresh food without systems** — "Fresh food — I've had a lot of it spoil and go bad. That takes a LOT more management and logistics. Tread carefully!" (Kyle Davey). Minimum $2 profit target on expiring items.

## 9. Kande VendTech Action Plan — Las Vegas

### 🔴 Priority 1: Immediate (This Week)

1. **Score your 91 prospects** against the qualification checklist in Section 3
   - 200+ units for residential, 150+ employees for industrial
   - Proximity to convenience stores
   - 24/7 access
   - Building type (high-rise > garden)
   - Rank them A/B/C

2. **Register as a reseller** at Costco and Sam's Club — stop paying sales tax on COGS immediately

3. **Set up a CRM** — every prospect, every touch, every follow-up date. Non-negotiable with a 10–12 week average sales cycle and 91 leads

4. **Arm your salesperson with the pitch deck:**
   - The $54 rent premium stat
   - "Smart market / AI-powered convenience" language (not "vending")
   - Qualifying questions checklist
   - Distributor advantage talking point (5,000 SKUs)

### 🟡 Priority 2: This Month

5. **Prioritize Class A luxury apartments and medical outpatient facilities** — these are the highest-performing location types. Las Vegas has tons of luxury high-rises and medical complexes

6. **Set pop-in targets:** Minimum 10–15 pop-ins per week. Batch into dedicated days if needed. Your salesperson's time doing pop-ins is the #1 growth lever — protect it

7. **Establish distributor relationships** — get set up with Vistar or a local distributor for single-SKU ordering and rebates. Stop buying variety packs

8. **Build your initial planogram** with real product dimensions and proven top sellers:
   - Core Water, Smartwater, Coke Zero (water/beverages)
   - Monster, Red Bull (energy — highest velocity)
   - Fair Life Core Power 42g protein (premium, high-margin)
   - Cheetos Flamin' Hot, Snickers, Skinny Pop (snacks)
   - Ramen, Pop-Tarts (high-margin staples)
   - At residential: TP, paper towels, Advil, laundry pods

9. **Price everything using the 3× rule** with psychological pricing ($2.49, $3.95, $7.99). Start high. You can always adjust down

### 🟢 Priority 3: First 90 Days

10. **Hire 2 part-time stockers** before you think you need them. Use Craigslist, screen for vehicle capacity (6+ bins). Redundancy from day one

11. **Secure storage/warehouse** — even a storage unit with 24/7 access and receiving capability is a game changer vs. running out of your home

12. **Install dedicated routers** at every location — don't rely on SIM cards

13. **Ask for referrals at every single touchpoint** — property managers know other property managers. One relationship can unlock multiple locations. Target the property management companies, not just individual buildings

14. **Push for mailroom/package-room placement** at every residential location — consistently the top performer

15. **Negotiate revenue share down** — push for $0 or flat $25/month. If they insist on percentage, go tiered/sliding to protect yourself on slow months

### 📊 Targets & Milestones

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Month 1–2 | First 2–3 machines placed in qualified A-locations |
| Month 3–4 | 5–8 machines, first stocker hired, warehouse/storage secured |
| Month 6 | 10+ machines, ~$10K+/month, distributor relationships active |
| Month 12 | 20+ machines, $20K+/month, 2 part-time stockers |
| Month 18 | 30+ machines, $35K+/month, warehouse + warehouse manager |
| Month 24 | 45+ locations, $75K+/month, ops manager hired, you're at 2 hrs/week |

### Las Vegas-Specific Advantages

- **Massive luxury apartment market** — Strip-adjacent high-rises are perfect targets
- **24/7 culture** — residents and tourists are up at all hours, driving vending demand
- **Medical corridor** — Henderson and Summerlin have clusters of outpatient facilities
- **Growing population** — new developments = "get in first" opportunities
- **Hot climate** — beverages (especially water and cold drinks) will be top sellers year-round
