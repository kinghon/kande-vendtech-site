## 1. Pricing Strategy

### Core Pricing Rules

| Rule | Source | Detail |
|------|--------|--------|
| **3x markup rule of thumb** | Jason Carlin (Scaling & Ops, 8/20/25) | "Rule of thumb: 3x markup on most items, except when cost/unit > $2" |
| **Target 50% minimum gross margin per item** | Kyle Davey (Foundations, 7/17/25) | "Minimum goal: 50% gross margin per item (e.g., buy at $1, sell at $2)" |
| **Target ~65% margin on most products** | Anthony (VendHub, 1/13/26) | "Target ~65% margin on most products; frozen items typically ~45–50%" |
| **Target ~60% overall margin** | Lane Folkers (Finance & Ops, 10/6/25) | "Typical gross margin target ~60% overall; apartments tend to be higher, refineries/price-sensitive sites closer to 50%" |
| **2–3x cost or 60% margins on average** | Lane Folkers (Finance & Ops, 9/15/25) | Standard guidance across the community |

### Pricing Psychology & Tactics

- **Use cost-plus pricing with psychological pricing** — e.g., $3.95 vs $4.00 for beverages (Ben Miller, 1/14/26)
- **Start higher, then adjust down** — "Underpricing is harder to recover from" (Jason Carlin, 8/20/25)
- **Cluster pricing by category** for customer simplicity (Kyle Davey, 7/17/25)
  - All chips at one price, all energy drinks at one price, etc.
- **Price to gas-station parity or slightly above** — this is the benchmark, NOT Walmart (Lane Folkers, 9/15/25)
- **Apartments tolerate higher pricing** due to convenience factor (Lane Folkers, 10/6/25)
- **Smart stores often don't show shelf prices** — users see at POS, reducing price sensitivity (Lane Folkers, 10/6/25)

### Profit Over Margin Percentage

> **Key insight:** "Prioritize profit over percentage margin—larger high-cost items can be more profitable than smaller high-margin items." — Anthony (VendHub, 1/13/26)

- A $5 item at 40% margin = $2 profit per unit
- A $2 item at 60% margin = $1.20 profit per unit
- **Evaluate freezer performance at the freezer level, not by individual item** (Weekly Call, 12/17/25)
- "Focus is less on margin and more on pennies earned per transaction" (Charles Wheeler, 9/16/25)

### Category-Specific Pricing Examples

| Category | COGS | Retail Price | Margin | Notes |
|----------|------|-------------|--------|-------|
| Energy drinks | ~$1.50-2.00 | $3.99 | ~50-65% | Highest velocity category |
| Chips/snacks | ~$0.60-1.00 | $2.49 | ~60-75% | |
| Regular candy | ~$0.50-0.75 | $1.75-2.00 | ~60-70% | |
| King-size candy | ~$1.25 | $3.39 | ~63% | |
| Sandwiches | $3.84-5.00 | $7.00-8.25 | ~40-55% | Higher absolute profit |
| Salads | $3.00 | $7.65 | ~61% | "$4.65/salad profit" |
| Core Water | $0.93 | $2.99 | ~69% | "Highest velocity seller" — net $1.70/bottle after fees |
| Red Bull 8.4oz | ~$2.00 | $3.75-3.99 | ~47-50% | |
| Red Bull 12oz | ~$2.50 | $4.99 | ~50% | |
| Cans of soda | $0.36 | $1.00-2.00 | ~64-82% | Buy on sale, load up for 3 months |
| Ramen | ~$0.30-0.50 | $1.50-2.00 | ~70%+ | "Sells exceptionally well with strong margins" |
| Pop-Tarts | ~$0.50 | $1.75-2.00 | ~65-70% | "High-margin and popular" |

### Bottles vs. Cans Strategy

- **Prefer bottles over cans** for higher dollar profit per unit
- "Avoid cans if you can: bottles boost profit per sale" (Lane Folkers)
- In some markets, operators price cans = bottles (e.g., $4 in LA)
- 16.9oz bottles preferred for better margin and manageable shelf life
- Transition to 20oz when feasible for even better margins
- Cans still needed in some price-sensitive markets — can use as "relationship sacrifices"

### White-Collar vs. Residential Pricing

- **White-collar offices** are more price-sensitive — surveys show complaints about pricing being "42% higher than Walmart"
- **Apartments** tolerate higher prices due to convenience — especially luxury apartments
- **Business locations** may restrict pricing changes and demand detailed price lists
- Consider offering cheaper cans alongside premium bottles at white-collar sites

### Revenue Share Models

| Model | Range | Notes |
|-------|-------|-------|
| **Flat monthly** | $25/month | Simplest approach |
| **Percentage of gross** | 3-5% | Most common |
| **Tiered/sliding** | Tied to monthly sales volume | Recommended — protects operators when sales are weak |
| **Profit share** | Varies | Less common |
| **No rev share** | $0 | Push for this when possible |

## 2. Location Strategy

### Best Location Types (Ranked)

1. **High-rise apartment towers** (downtown, with Airbnb units) — best for open markets, $6K-7K/month
2. **Luxury apartments** (200+ units, high occupancy) — strong and less price-sensitive
3. **Large office buildings** (200+ employees) — high foot traffic
4. **Medical buildings** (300+ staff + foot traffic) — strong lead
5. **Manufacturing/warehouses** — lucrative ($10K+/month) but competitive
6. **Student housing** — high volume but watch for theft

### Location Evaluation Criteria

- **Unit count/resident count** — primary driver
- **Foot traffic patterns** — daily habits matter most
- **Placement within the building** — mailroom > clubhouse > fitness center > poolside
- **Occupancy rate** — enter early at high-potential properties, even at 0% occupancy
- **Demographics** — affects pricing tolerance and product mix
- **Visibility** — machines must be easily seen and accessible
- **24/7 access** — avoid time-restricted clubhouses

### What Works

- **Mailrooms/package rooms** — consistently strongest performers in garden-style apartments
- **Elevator lobbies** — forced foot traffic
- **Break rooms in offices** — captive audience
- **Downtown tower lobbies** — Airbnb guest traffic is a bonus
- **Being "first in" at new properties** — builds strong placement relationships

### What Doesn't Work

- **Garden-style clubhouses** — limited traffic, theft risk
- **Fitness centers/pool areas** — consistently underperform
- **Time-restricted common rooms** — hours kill sales
- **Sight from the street** — invites vandalism ("Don't put machines in sight from the street" — Kyle Davey)
- **Suboptimal placement by property managers** — push back diplomatically

### Key Metrics

| Location Type | Expected Revenue | Restock Frequency |
|--------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Open market (tower) | $6K-7K/month | 2-3x/week |
| Stockwell (luxury 250-unit) | $2,195/month (first month case study) | 2x/week |
| Micro-market (typical) | ~$3.5K/month | 2x/week |
| Business (manufacturing) | $10K+/month | 2-3x/week |
| Small office (175 employees) | Variable — can be challenging | 1-2x/week |

### First Month Case Study (Michael Deese, Houston)

- **Location:** Luxury apartment, 246 units, 95% occupied
- **Results:** 818 items sold, $2,195 pre-tax, 36% COGS
- **Avg transactions/day:** 11
- **Revenue per unit per month:** $8.92
- **Top sellers:** Sprite (57), Monster (50), Snapple Kiwi (43), Cheetos Flamin Hot (38), Snickers (28)

### Equipment Selection by Location

| Location Type | Recommended Equipment | Notes |
|--------------|----------------------|-------|
| Premium high-rise | Stockwell (365) | Reliable, secure, higher fees |
| Large property (200+) | PicoVision combo | Better capacity |
| Standard apartment | Haha Pro | Cost-effective |
| Micro-market format | Moneta kiosk | Best service, lower than 365 fees |
| Open market | Cantaloupe (swap kiosk for Moneta) | Reduce fees |

## 3. Operations

### Restocking & Inventory

- **Central warehouse is critical** — consolidate orders from multiple vendors, prep inventory
- **Restock before machines run low** — track sales and stockouts with software
- **Align delivery days** from different vendors when possible
- **Use insulated containers** (Cambro boxes) for temperature-sensitive products
- **Planogram strategy:** Start with generalized layouts, adjust based on local demand
- Focus on top-selling products first (Coke, Diet Coke, Gatorade, Fairlife), then experiment

### Supplier Strategy

| Supplier | Best For | Notes |
|----------|----------|-------|
| **Sam's Club** | Beverages, bulk items | Far cheaper than VendHub for most drinks |
| **Costco** | Sandwiches, variety | Costco ham/turkey sandwiches ($3.84 COGS → $8.25 retail) |
| **Vistar** | Variety, bulk, rebates | $750 min order to avoid shipping; variety pack staple |
| **Walmart** | Fill-in items, bagged candy | Pick-up ordering convenient |
| **VendHub** | Hard-to-source SKUs, quality fresh | Better quality wraps/sandwiches than Walmart |

- **Register as reseller immediately** at Costco/Sam's to avoid paying sales tax — "no way to claw back sales tax after paying" (Thomas Rohlader)
- Buy drinks on sale and "load up for 3 months" (Michael Deese)

### Software & Reporting

| Platform | Reporting | Payouts | Notes |
|----------|-----------|---------|-------|
| **365/Stockwell** | Robust web reporting ("Sales Analysis") | Weekly (Fridays) | "Bulletproof on payment capture" |
| **Haha** | merchant.hahavending.com exports | On-demand (2 free/month) | Device/product rankings with gross margin |
| **Moneta** | Good micro-market tools | Weekly (Wed/Thu) | Best service quality |
| **MicroMart** | Scheduling features | Varies | Smart cooler specific |

- **QuickBooks Solopreneur** — adequate for P&L, cheap
- **VenSoft** — for multi-platform inventory and reporting consolidation
- **Avoid "vending" language** — use "smart market" or "AI marketplace" to improve perception

### Connectivity

- Use **dedicated routers** over SIM cards for stability
- Run speed tests pre-install
- **Haha router:** ~$15/month; remove SIM after confirming Wi-Fi
- **Cellular options:** WTI ($25/month), OptConnect ($45/month)
- Some enterprises prohibit third-party payment on their Wi-Fi — use cellular gateways

### Merchandising

- **Do a thorough planogram with real product dimensions** before stocking
- Test-fit tall bottles — bottle heights reduce usable shelves
- Use chip/snack dividers with spring pressure for consistent fronting
- **Healthy items:** Stock if required to close deal, but monitor performance and rotate underperforming SKUs
- Despite manager preferences, **top sellers remain energy drinks, candy, and frozen items**

---

## 4. Scaling

### Growth Path

- **Start small** — 2 machines at a new location, scale based on performance
- **Build operational "muscle memory"** before scaling
- **Pop-ins are essential** — "Stopped doing pop-ins after landing first location — big mistake. Momentum matters!" (Thomas Rohlader)
- **Typical process to close a location:** ~3 months

### Hiring Stockers

- **Craigslist** most effective platform — screen for vehicle capacity (aim to fit 6+ bins)
- Word-of-mouth via social media also effective
- Start with trusted people in your network
- **Part-time vs. full-time trade-off:** PT = more flexible but higher turnover; FT = stability but risk if they leave
- **Multiple part-time stockers** recommended — if one quits, others cover
- **Show up and grind with your team** — best morale boost (Anthony Kolodziej)

### Financing Strategy

- **0% APR credit cards** — operators funding ~$50K in equipment with staggered cards
- Chase Ink Cash/Unlimited: $6K spend/3 months, $900 bonus, 0% APR for 12 months
- Amex Blue Business Plus: $3K spend, lower bonus, easier approval
- **Stagger applications 30-90 days apart** to extend interest-free timelines
- Track with spreadsheets + Travel Freely app
- **Pay off before promo APR ends** — otherwise 18-25% kicks in

### Route Efficiency

- Monitor revenue-to-labor ratios as you scale
- Example benchmark: $3,500 revenue for 8 labor hours + expenses
- **Move underperforming units** before buying more — one operator doubled revenue by moving a micro-market to a different building within the same campus

### Scaling Financials

- **Buying existing routes:** 0.5x-1x annual revenue for distressed routes; up to 2x for better-run setups
- PE groups entering the market buying routes >$10M/year — "Supply & Demand in an industry going through disruption is great for you guys"
- **Micro-markets consistently outperform** traditional vending and smart coolers, often 50-100% more sales

## 5. Mistakes & Lessons Learned

### Top Mistakes (from Kyle Davey, Thomas Rohlader, and community)

1. **Stopping pop-ins after first location** — momentum matters, keep prospecting
2. **Not testing every item before opening** — scan everything, SKUs change
3. **Placing machines in sight from the street** — invites vandalism
4. **Underpricing** — harder to raise prices than to start high
5. **Overcommitting on equipment** before qualifying the location
6. **Not registering as reseller** at Costco/Sam's — paying unnecessary sales tax
7. **Ignoring planogram dimensions** — tall bottles waste vertical shelf space
8. **Leaving damaged machines in bad neighborhoods** — "Bad guys probably aren't going to stop"
9. **Promising "all healthy" product mix** — products won't move
10. **Not having backup stockers** — "Two stockers quit abruptly via text on the day they were supposed to stock"

### Location-Specific Failures

- **89-unit luxury place with Stockwell:** Only $97 first week despite "good lobby location" — "Win some, lose some"
- **Government contract with 15% rev share + insurance:** Only $700/month across machines — "Should have scouted locations ahead of time"
- **Open market in garden-style clubhouse:** Failed due to limited traffic and theft
- **Two micro-markets in admin building ($18K equipment):** Less than $100/day — moved one to maintenance building, doubled revenue

### Fresh Food Challenges

- "Fresh food — I've had a lot of it spoil and go bad. That takes a LOT more management and logistics to make a success. Tread carefully!" (Kyle Davey)
- Fresh items require careful quantity planning
- Minimum $2 profit target on expiring items like sandwiches
- "Better to sell quality items that move than cheap items that sit and expire"

### Technical Mistakes

- **Stockwell lockout:** Machine went into temperature lockout mode after install — no sales until manually fixed
- **Connectivity failures:** SIM cards can be spotty; dedicated routers more reliable
- **Unlocking Stockwell with key during power outage:** Door doesn't relock — nearly cleaned out of drinks
- **Stripped screws on delivery:** Keep a screw extractor kit handy

## 6. Key Actionable Takeaways for Kande VendTech

### Pricing Playbook

1. **Set initial prices at 3x cost** as starting point; adjust down only if data requires it
2. **Target 60-65% gross margin** on ambient products, accept 45-50% on frozen
3. **Price to local gas station parity or slightly above** — never compare to Walmart
4. **Use psychological pricing** — $3.95 not $4.00, $2.49 not $2.50
5. **Cluster pricing by category** — all energy drinks at $3.99, all chips at $2.49
6. **Evaluate profit per unit, not margin percentage** — a $7 sandwich at 40% margin beats a $2 candy at 65%
7. **Start high, adjust down** — never the reverse

### Product Strategy

1. **Top sellers across the community:** Monster, Red Bull, Coke/Sprite, Gatorade, Cheetos Flamin' Hot, Snickers
2. **High-profit items:** Ramen (70%+ margin), Pop-Tarts (65%+), Core Water ($1.70 net/bottle)
3. **Best fresh items:** Costco sandwiches ($3.84 → $8.25), quality salads ($3 → $7.65)
4. **Prefer bottles over cans** for higher per-unit profit
5. **Stock name brands** — they outsell everything else
6. **Include healthy options** if required to close a deal, but monitor and rotate

### Location Playbook

1. **Target luxury apartments 200+ units** as primary market — less price-sensitive, easier access
2. **Push for mailroom/package room placement** — consistently best performers
3. **Avoid fitness centers and clubhouses** unless high-traffic
4. **Get in early at new developments** — long-term relationship advantage
5. **Don't use "vending" language** — position as "smart market" or "AI-powered convenience"
6. **Qualify thoroughly:** unit count, foot traffic, 24/7 access, placement quality

### Operations Playbook

1. **Register as reseller** immediately for tax-exempt purchasing
2. **Use Sam's Club for beverages** and VendHub for specialty/fresh items
3. **Invest in a central warehouse** early — streamlines everything
4. **Build planograms with real dimensions** before install day
5. **Install dedicated routers** — don't rely on SIM cards
6. **Track everything:** use platform reports + QuickBooks for P&L

### Scaling Playbook

1. **Never stop pop-ins** — even after landing locations
2. **Use 0% APR business credit cards** to fund equipment without interest
3. **Hire multiple part-time stockers** for redundancy
4. **Move underperforming machines** before buying new ones
5. **Micro-markets outperform smart coolers by 50-100%** — favor open market formats where possible
6. **Tiered revenue share** protects you during slow months

### Key Numbers to Remember

| Metric | Target |
|--------|--------|
| Gross margin (ambient) | 60-65% |
| Gross margin (frozen) | 45-50% |
| Net margin (after fees, labor, overhead) | 30-35% |
| Revenue per apartment unit/month | $8-10 |
| Average transactions/day (Stockwell) | 11+ |
| Restock frequency | Every 3-4 days |
| Time to close a location | ~3 months |
| Revenue share | 0-5% (push for tiered or zero) |

- Ghost Energy ($1.57/ea from Costco 15-packs)
- Starbucks Frappuccinos (luxury apartments)
- Fairlife (protein shakes)
- SmartWater (premium pricing works)
- Sparkling Ice (surprisingly popular + cheap to source)

**Snacks — Universal Top Sellers:**
- Cheetos Flamin' Hot (consistently #1 snack)
- Snickers
- Pop-Tarts (high margin, eat from cooler)
- Famous Amos cookies
- Doritos (Cool Ranch specifically)
- Nerds Gummy Clusters
- Trolli Sour Brite Crawlers
- KitKat / Twix
- Skinny Pop Popcorn
- Garden Veggie Straws (surprise hit)
- Big Texas Cinnamon Rolls

**Frozen — High-Ticket Items:**
- Frozen pizzas ($7.50 retail)
- Uncrustables (need freezer, not cooler)
- Ice cream tubs ($6.50 retail)
- Hot Pockets (frozen only, don't put in fridge)
- Pot pies
- Frozen burritos/breakfast sandwiches

**Healthy Options — What Actually Sells:**
- Chomps meat sticks (gyms especially)
- Quest protein chips (gym locations)
- Core Power protein shakes
- Coconut water
- Fairlife
- Fit Crunch bars
- Poppy prebiotic soda (often allowed under Coke exclusivity)
- **Reality:** "People like to think they want healthy options. Not every location really does." "You can walk a horse to water, but you can't make it drink."

**By Location Type:**
- **Warehouses/Blue-collar:** Famous Amos, Monster, Coke, Snickers, ramen, burritos
- **Gyms:** Chomps, Quest, Core Power, protein bars, coconut water
- **Student housing:** Arizona, Dr Pepper, Cool Blue Gatorade, Cheerwine, Nissin Chow Mein, Nerds Gummy Clusters, condoms (sell well!)
- **Luxury apartments:** Starbucks Frappuccinos, Celsius, SmartWater, salads, premium sandwiches
- **LA-specific warning:** "None of the best selling products people in this group recommend sell for me in LA" — region matters

### Product Rotation Strategy (Thomas Rohlader)

> "I get rid of my 3 worst selling products monthly. Also, any products I can't keep in stock, I double down and expand product selection for those types of products. I also tend to raise prices on my best selling products over time."

### Revenue Share Contract Language (Actual Template)

> "The Vendor shall pay the Owner **2% of revenue monthly** from any vending machine/micro market(s) placed on the Premises. This amount shall be **increased to 5% of revenue monthly** if an introduction is made to another property that results in a new machine/micro market being placed at the property. The increase shall take effect in the month the new contract is signed."

### Revenue Share Deep Dive (from Classroom)

- **Typical range:** 3-15%, average 5-10%
- **Canteen (major competitor)** often offers 25% — but offsets with hidden fees and poor service
- **Tiered models recommended:** 0% until baseline revenue, then increasing as sales rise
- Even $200-300/month rev share is meaningful to local property managers (measured on amenity budgets)
- Push for in-person meeting before quoting numbers — never negotiate over email
- **Key insight:** "While small to corporate, even $200–$300/month rev share is meaningful to local managers"

### Break-Even Analysis (from Tim Barnes Classroom Recording)

| Metric | Number |
|--------|--------|
| **Monthly break-even per machine** | ~$800-900 revenue |
| **At $450/month** | Losing $200+/month even with no commissions |
| **COGS target** | ~40% of revenue |
| **True overhead per machine** | Insurance + storage + admin + fees + labor |

> "Many operators underestimate overhead (insurance, storage, admin)"

### Theft: What Operators Are Experiencing

**Common theft scenarios:**
- Kids reaching up with tongs to grab candy from Futura machines
- Prepaid card fraud on Haha machines
- Stockwell doors not relocking after key unlock during power outage
- Open market / micro-market format more vulnerable than smart coolers
- Garden-style apartments higher risk than towers

**Theft mitigation:**
- Security doors on Futura machines "eliminated my theft problem"
- Smart coolers (Stockwell) inherently more secure than open markets
- Camera footage from machines for evidence
- Place machines OUT of sight from street — reduces vandalism
- Insurance through FLIP covers theft ($500 deductible typical)
- Contract language: property should share liability if resident steals

### Promotions That Work (from Classroom Recordings)

- **Social media posts by property managers** → boosted sales 20% in one portfolio
- **Flyers + door hangers** → build awareness (residents often don't know machines exist!)
- **"Product of the month"** at steep discount → drives trial
- **"Penny hour"** or mystery free item → encourages frequent visits
- **Gamification** → social media challenges, happy hour pricing
- **Leave product list by machines** → get customer input on what to stock
- **Free product for building staff** → builds goodwill and word-of-mouth

### Equipment Comparison (Community Consensus)

| Machine | Best For | Pros | Cons |
|---------|----------|------|------|
| **Stockwell (365)** | Premium luxury locations | Sleek design, one-tap access, bulletproof payment, strong reporting | Highest fees, ~$4-5K/machine |
| **MicroMart** | Modern locations wanting big screen | Property managers love large screens, startup-style backend | Cumbersome user flow (27+ taps), phone number entry |
| **Haha** | Budget-friendly starts, mid-tier | Cost-effective, decent app/reporting | Prepaid card fraud risk, SIM connectivity issues |
| **Futura** | Combo snack/drink, garden-style | Lower cost | Theft vulnerability (bottom candy row), no doors |
| **PicoVision (365)** | Large properties 200+ units | Better capacity than Stockwell | Higher cost |
| **Moneta** | Open micro-markets | Best service, lowest fees, kiosk format | Not for smart coolers |
| **SandStar** | New option being evaluated | AI features | Too new to judge |

> **General rule:** "Higher end locations → Stockwell or MicroMart. Haha in between." (Neil Read)
> **Stockwell generally favored** until MicroMart improves user experience

### First Location Win Data (Real Numbers from Community)

| Operator | Location | Machine | Results |
|----------|----------|---------|---------|
| Michael Deese | Luxury apt, 246 units, Houston | Stockwell | $2,195/month, 818 items, 36% COGS |
| Alexis Bourbeau | 3 Stockwells | Stockwell | **Paid off all 3 machines in 68 days** from earnings |
| Jeremy Woldert | 400+ unit wrap building | MicroMart | White-glove setup, by package locker |
| Jamie Long | 1K apt high-rise | PicoVision | ADM 356 products loaded |
| Danny Jackson | Gymnastics center | Unknown | $100+ in first 2 days |
| Kelsey Garman | First location | Unknown | $30 in first 4 hours |
| Tim Barnes community | Open markets (towers) | Open market | $6K-7K/month vs $3.5K micromarket |
| Lane Folkers | Two micro-markets in admin building | 365 | <$100/day → **moved one to maintenance building, doubled revenue** |

### Frozen Food Strategy (Community + Classroom)

- **"Frozen food is a very untapped market — lots of high ticket items and they never spoil!"** (Thomas Rohlader)
- First week selling frozen: 3 pepperoni pizzas at $7.50 + 3 ice cream tubs at $6.50 = expecting $200-300 additional monthly revenue
- Source from Walmart and Vistar
- Manufacturing plants with 3 shifts need breakfast/lunch/dinner items in freezers
- If location has microwave available → frozen meals are huge (pot pies, ramen, burritos)
- **Don't put frozen food in fridges** — it needs a real freezer
- AMPS framework for freezer merchandising: Assortment, Merchandising, Pricing, Shelving

### Warehouse & Storage Progression

| Stage | Setup | Cost |
|-------|-------|------|
| 0-5 locations | Home garage | Free |
| 5-10 locations | Shared warehouse (WeWork for warehouses) | ~$1,000/month for 750 sq ft |
| 10+ locations | Dedicated warehouse | $1,300+ for 1,300 sq ft |

- Central warehouse enables Vistar delivery (need dock/forklift access)
- "Biggest reason for warehouse move was saving stockers 30 minutes of commute time"
- Plan delivery coordination: align vendor delivery days when possible

### Sales Tax Mistake (Critical)

> **"Don't be like me, get registered as a reseller at your local Costco and Sam's Club IMMEDIATELY! There's no way to claw back any sales tax you've paid after you pay it."** — Thomas Rohlader (13 likes, highly upvoted)

Steps:
1. Register as reseller with your state (call State Department of Revenue)
2. Get reseller license
3. Use it to get tax-exempt at all major retailers

## 8. Additional Classroom Insights

### P&L Model Deep Dive (Tim Barnes, 8/21/25)

**True cost per machine per month:**
- COGS: ~40% of revenue
- Platform/POS fees: varies by machine (365 highest, Moneta lowest)
- Credit card processing: bundled into platform fees
- Insurance: allocated per machine
- Storage: allocated per machine
- Admin time: often underestimated
- Labor (if hiring stockers): per-route calculation

**Break-even reality:** Machine doing <$800/month is likely losing money once ALL costs factored in

### Awareness Problem (Tim Barnes, 8/21/25)

> "Locations often underperform due to lack of awareness. Examples: residents didn't know machines existed despite months onsite."

**Solutions proven to work:**
- Property manager social media posts (20% sales lift)
- Flyers in mailboxes/doors
- Grand opening promotions (10-25% off first week)
- QR codes linking to product menus
- Building staff as advocates (give them free product they like)

### Negotiation Tactics (Multiple Sources)

**With property managers:**
- "No surprises" approach — share performance updates early
- Send underperformance notices, allow 30-90 days for correction before pulling machine
- Weekly internal reporting; share externally only with troubled locations
- **Don't say "vending"** — say "smart market," "AI marketplace," "amenity solution"
- Bring tape measure, show machine photos, highlight customization and wraps
- Leave business cards + small gifts (cookies, local treats)

**Handling objections:**
- Space concerns → show exact measurements, offer multiple configurations
- Revenue share → frame as minor compared to amenity value for residents
- Theft concerns → explain smart cooler technology, camera footage, insurance
- "We already have vending" → offer to compare quality/service/technology
- Price sensitivity → use data on convenience premium, resident satisfaction

### Machine Selection Decision Framework (Lane Folkers, 9/22/25)

1. **Assess unit count** — Stockwell for <200 units, PicoVision for 200+
2. **Assess placement** — mailroom/lobby (Stockwell), larger break room (micro-market)
3. **Assess demographics** — luxury (Stockwell/365), budget (Haha), blue-collar (combo machines)
4. **Assess security** — high-theft risk (smart cooler), low-theft (open market)
5. **Assess budget** — Haha for starting out, upgrade as revenue justifies
6. **Restock frequency** — Stockwell needs restocking every ~4 days for 100-unit building

### Cold Email Campaign Templates (Kickoff Module)

The community runs a **done-for-you email campaign system** under the "Modern Amenities" brand. Key templates by industry:

**Apartments:**
- Email 1: "Would [Property] benefit from 24/7 fresh food?" — zero cost, tenant satisfaction angle
- Email 2: Custom mockup offer — "We'll create a mockup of what a market could look like in your space"
- Email 3: "We have our operator in the area" — competitor reference, 5-10 minute drop-in ask

**Warehouses:**
- Employee perk angle — "round-the-clock fresh meals"
- Zero management burden — addresses busy managers
- Health/wellness emphasis

**Medical:**
- Dual benefit (staff + patients/visitors)
- Wait time solution — "patients grab snacks during wait"
- No operations impact

**Key Tactics Across All:**
- Progressive commitment (low-risk asks → meetings)
- Industry-specific language and benefits
- Social proof without being pushy
- Urgency via competitor references
- Always personalized with actual company names + LinkedIn research

### Pop-In Script (Boots on the Ground Module)

> "Hey my name's XXX I own a local luxury smart market business. We place luxury smart machines in locations like this **at no cost to you**. Do you currently have vending on the property?"
>
> **If yes:** "Are you happy with your current service?" — try to find if poorly serviced
>
> **If no:** "We offer free placement, stocking, and upkeep of luxury smart markets. Is the Property Manager in to potentially get a free evaluation for placement?"
>
> Goal: Get meeting with PM right then OR get PM's contact info for follow-up

### Follow-Up Protocol (Boots on the Ground Module)

1. **Week 1:** Follow up 3 times by email
2. **After that:** 1 email per week
3. **Every 2 weeks:** Phone call
4. **Monthly:** Pop-in to the location

> "No answer does NOT mean they're not interested! They just don't have time to answer you right now."
> "Vending is at the BOTTOM of Property Managers' to-do lists"
> "Vending is a game of months and years, not days and weeks"

**Follow-up email examples that work:**
- "Hey PM, an operator in my group is installing these MicroMarts at a similar location to yours. Will you be there if I swing by around 3PM Friday?"
- "Hey PM, I'm chatting with X Brand about getting placed in smart markets. I think your residents would love X Brand, are you available to chat?"
- "Hey PM, I'll be down your way refilling machines next Wednesday. Would you be free sometime that morning?"

### Objection Handling (Boots on the Ground Module)

**"We already have a machine"** → Bring revenue share into conversation. Ask if they get a cut. Offer percentage of profits.

**"Can I get references?"** → Leverage Modern Amenities national brand. Use provided reference threads.

**"Manager isn't in"** → Talk to receptionist, get them excited, get manager's business card. Pop in again later.

### How To Close A Lead (Boots on the Ground Module)

1. Take a picture of the potential placement location
2. Make a custom mockup (using MicroMart images is most powerful)
3. Put the apartment's logo on the MicroMart screen
4. Send mockup to decision maker — show their branding potential
5. Mention potential ad space on top of the machine
> "This will get the attention of higher ups especially"

### Machine Selection Decision Tree (Machine Selection Module)

Community provides a **Google Sheets decision tree** that maps:
- Location type → recommended machine
- Unit count → machine size/format
- Demographics → feature priority
- Budget → financing options

Key resources: Decision tree spreadsheet + Loom walkthrough video

### Route Acquisition Strategy (Jason Carlin, 1/7/2026)

**Valuation:**
- **Buy at 50-80% of annualized revenue** — preferred range
- **Never pay 1x revenue** unless exceptional conditions
- Smaller routes (2-6 locations) don't warrant business multiples regardless of seller ask
- Don't overpay for websites or leads — "Can we recreate this ourselves for less than the premium?"

**Where to find routes:**
- Local machine suppliers (best source)
- Direct outreach to aging operators
- Cold-calling operators in your geographic market
- **Facebook Marketplace** increasingly unreliable and risky
- Many operators quietly looking to exit — build relationships early

**Contract protections when buying:**
- Transferable contracts where possible
- Sliding-scale recoupment clauses if terminated early
- Seller "skin in the game" through multi-year protections
- If risk feels excessive, walk away rather than overengineer contracts

**Location performance thresholds:**
- **<$500/month per location** = typically not worth servicing standalone
- Portfolio relationships may justify keeping underperformers
- One-off low performers are candidates for removal

**Pricing by demographic:**
- Slow/lower-income locations → cans preferred
- B- and A-class properties → bottles preferred
- 20oz bottles at $3.00 is the **floor**, not the ceiling
- Benchmark against gas stations + CVS/Walgreens + taxes/fees

### Restocking Operations (Community Posts — 397 results!)

**Best practices:**
- Use moving boxes for pre-packing and organizing inventory
- Rolling cart for transport to/from machines
- Some use plastic totes, others milk crates
- "Restock everything above 1 needed — might as well have everything full" (J and Ahlian M)

**Restock frequency:**
- Top-performing locations: every 2 days
- Standard locations: twice per week
- Low-performing: once per week

**MicroMart FIFO challenge:** Pulling old stock to put new behind is tedious — operators debate optimal restock thresholds (50% empty vs. any item at 1)

**Hiring first restocker:**
- Community resources + Gusto for payroll
- Key is making routes efficient enough to justify hire
- Multiple part-timers for redundancy
