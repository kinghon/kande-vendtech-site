## 📍 Location Strategy

### The #1 Rule: Foot Traffic, Foot Traffic, Foot Traffic
> "You could have the best machines, best products, best service, but if you don't have foot traffic, you don't have a business." — Anthony

**Qualify locations like real estate investments.** Anthony (45 locations, $102K/month) came from a real estate background and treats every location evaluation like a $150K flip — asking the right questions, measuring traffic, and calculating ROI before committing.

### Top 3 Location Types (Ranked by Performance)

#### 1. Class A Luxury Apartments (⭐ Best for Kande)
- **Minimum threshold:** 200 units per building
- **Why they crush it:** 24/7 access, residents have disposable income, not price-conscious
- **Key insight:** Residents won't walk 2-3 blocks to a convenience store at 11:30 PM — they'll take the elevator to your machine
- **Leasing advantage:** Property managers love it because it's an amenity they show during tours
- **Revenue stat:** A study showed having vending/convenience inside a building equates to **$54/unit in premium rent** — use this in your pitch
- **Critical rule:** **Single building ONLY. Garden-style apartments are a HARD PASS**
- **Scaling hack:** The property management company usually manages OTHER properties in the area — one relationship can unlock multiple locations
- **Shannon's unicorn:** One luxury apartment/condo/long-term hotel combo in Seattle doing **$22,000–$25,000/month** from a single micro market setup

#### 2. Multi-Shift Warehouse/Manufacturing Facilities
- **Minimum threshold:** 150 employees
- **Why they work:** Captive audience, limited nearby food options, short 15-min breaks mean workers can't leave
- **Best placement:** Employee break room (micro market format works well here)
- **Qualifying questions to ask:**
  - "How stable is the company? Are you growing?"
  - "How many employees per shift?" (Don't assume — Anthony once assumed a 2nd shift had 75 people when it only had 3)
  - "Are you opening new divisions or hiring?"
- **Growth potential:** If company is expanding, your revenue grows automatically

#### 3. Medical Outpatient Facilities
- **Why Anthony loves these:** "I wish I could add more of these to my portfolio"
- **Minimum threshold:** 150 employees + 100 patients daily (250+ total daily foot traffic)
- **Why they crush it:**
  - Doctors/nurses work 12-hour shifts, grab Fair Life protein ($7.99) as meal replacements
  - High-income staff = not price-conscious
  - Patients waiting 30-45 min for appointments buy impulsively
  - **Recession-proof** — people always need to see doctors
  - High-stress environment → impulsive buying decisions
- **Pro tip:** Ask if the facility uses **Placer AI** — one facility sent Anthony 3 years of foot traffic data (400 patients/day M-F)

### Location Red Flags 🚩
- **Convenience store within a couple blocks** — kills your traffic
- **Placing machines for YOUR convenience** — Anthony put a machine 5 min from his house, it only did $700-800/month
- **Not asking about shift sizes** — Always ask how many people are on EACH shift
- **Garden-style apartments** — Hard pass, not enough concentrated foot traffic
- **Locations too far from your hub** — Shannon keeps a 10-15 mile radius max; turned down a 69-mile opportunity
- **Small employee count** — Under 150 employees for industrial, under 200 units for residential
- **Free snack programs** — Ask: "Do you supply snacks for free?" If yes, that undercuts your machine

### Location Placement Within the Building
> "If you place it in the wrong part of the building, it could decrease your sales by 25%." — Anthony

- Ask: "Where's the most foot traffic in the building?"
- Consider: package room area, amenity lounge, lobby
- Leverage the property manager's knowledge — they know where people congregate

### Evaluate Like Real Estate
- Anthony: "I qualified locations the same way I qualify properties. Foot traffic, demand, and whether people are actually there every day."
- Shannon's criteria for her unicorn: High-rises + apartments + condos + long-term hotel ALL in one building = massive captive audience

## 🤝 Sales / Pop-in Strategy

### The Basics
> "Vending machines is by far the easiest sales job I've ever had. There's almost no objections, and the ones that there are, they're relatively easy to overcome." — Kyle ($40K/month)

### Pop-in Cadence
- **Kyle's approach:** Pop-ins 1-2x per week when actively growing
- **Anthony's approach:** When he had flexibility, he'd do **15-20 pop-ins in a single day** (Saturday or flexible weekday)
- **Conversion rate:** Roughly 1 in 10 pop-ins converts (sometimes 3 in 10, sometimes 0 in 20 — "law of averages, it always averages out")

### Sales Cycle Reality
> "It's the longest sales cycle I've ever had. Sometimes it takes 10-12 weeks or even longer. 6, 7, 8 months I've been chasing some leads. The fastest I've got is same week, but that was like a unicorn." — Kyle

- **Key insight for Kande's 91 prospects:** Don't give up on leads. Kyle's explosive Q2 was just old leads finally saying yes — "all these yeses just kind of started trickling in for leads I'd been talking to for months"
- **Follow-up is everything.** Use a CRM religiously. "Have a CRM so you don't lose track of your leads" — Kyle

### What to Say / Pitch Elements
1. **Frame it as an amenity, not a vendor placement**
   - "You're providing an amenity to the building"
   - Leasing agents use it to show potential tenants
2. **Use the $54 rent premium stat:** Having vending/convenience equates to $54/unit in premium rent — that's added NOI for the owner
3. **Distributor advantage:** When property managers ask "You're not just buying from Costco, right?" — Anthony would say: "I got a distributor with 5,000 SKUs. You want Starbucks, all gummies, spicy Gardetto Italian trail mix — you got it." This closed deals against competitors who could only offer variety packs
4. **Ask for referrals:** "What other properties do you manage? Do you know other people?" — Property managers are all friends, it's a small industry

### Qualifying Questions During Pop-ins
- Where's the most foot traffic in the building?
- How many units/employees? (Get specific per shift)
- Do you supply snacks for free?
- What are your business hours?
- Is the company growing/hiring?
- Is it by the package room or amenity lounge?
- Do you manage other properties?

### Mindset on Rejection
> "For every door I knocked on trying to sell a newspaper subscription, I was probably 1 for 50. But when I got that one, I made 150 bucks as a 14-year-old. I don't remember all the rejections. I remember that Oakland Raiders fan and how I sold him the DVR." — Kyle

- In baseball, you strike out 7/10 times and still make the All-Star game
- Rejection is part of the gig — accept it and keep going

## ⚙️ Operations

### Restocking Frequency
- **High-volume locations (unicorn):** 3-4x per week (Shannon's $25K location: Monday, Wednesday, Friday + Saturday/Sunday)
- **Standard locations:** Weekly or as needed
- **Critical lesson:** Shannon's first location sold out in 48 HOURS — be prepared to adjust

### Inventory Management
- **Early stage:** You can eyeball it with a few machines
- **At scale (15-25+ machines):** You MUST systemize
  - Kyle: "I walked into the warehouse and the rack where we keep the Coke was full. After one day of restocking, it was almost empty. I'm like, all right, I'm going to have to figure out how to systemize this."
  - Create scheduled sales analysis per machine
  - Track what's selling vs. sitting

### The Variety Pack Problem
> "I would order Gatorade Zero and it would come in a variety pack — fruit punch, glacier cherry, lemon lime. Lemon lime sells 3x more. My warehouse guy sends me photos of oversupply of the other flavors." — Anthony

- **Effective cost per unit with variety packs is 50+ cents HIGHER** due to waste/oversupply
- **Solution:** Use distributor relationships to order single-SKU cases
- This applies to ANY variety pack from Costco/Sam's

### Sourcing Strategy (Progressive)
1. **Starting out:** Costco Business Center, Sam's Club
2. **Scaling up:** Distributor relationships for single-SKU ordering, better pricing, delivery
3. **Key advantages of distributors:**
   - Single-flavor ordering (no variety pack waste)
   - Rebate checks quarterly (3-12% depending on product)
   - Competitive advantage in sales pitches
   - Delivery to warehouse (saves time)

### Top-Selling Products (Across All Operators)
| Product | Price Point | Notes |
|---------|------------|-------|
| Smartwater 20oz | — | Shannon's #1 seller ($6K/month in water alone at unicorn location) |
| Coke Zero 20oz | — | Anthony's top seller across route |
| Fair Life Core Power (42g protein) | $7.99 | "Flying off the shelf — people view it as a meal replacement" |
| Skinny Pop White Cheddar 1oz | — | Anthony hunted Dollar Trees for this before distributor access |
| Gatorade Zero Lemon Lime | — | Sells 3x more than other Gatorade Zero flavors |

### Non-Traditional Products That Sell Well
- **Toilet paper (Charmin 6-pack):** $16.99 sell price, ~$8 cost = 50%+ margin (Shannon sells 2-3/week)
- **Paper towels, laundry pods** — convenience items in residential
- **Advil, Excedrin, cough drops** — incidentals sell surprisingly well
- **Condoms, shampoo, conditioner** — Shannon: "Our incidentals actually do really well"
- **Dog treats** — Anthony adding by customer request
- **Room temperature water** — Some customers specifically want this (Shannon added 40 bottles near checkout)

### Warehouse & Storage Progression
1. **Start:** Living room / garage (Shannon ran out of an 800 sq ft home for 6 months)
2. **Growth:** Storage unit with 24/7 access
3. **Scale:** Dedicated warehouse (Kyle got one in the city where his machines are, an hour from home)
4. **Key feature needed:** Receiving capability — having a place that can receive deliveries when you're not there is a game-changer

### Smart Coolers vs. Traditional Machines
- Anthony runs **mostly AI smart coolers** with only 5 traditional machines
- Smart coolers advantage: "90% of issues can be troubleshot remotely — it's just a refrigerator with a terminal, compressor, and computer"
- Traditional machines: "Biggest pain in the butt — coils, cash box, coin dispenser, so many things can go wrong"
- Traditional only where location requires that type of protection

## 📈 Scaling

### Growth Milestones & Timeline
| Milestone | Timeline | Revenue |
|-----------|----------|---------|
| First machine | Month 1 | $700-$800/month (bad location) to $3K+ (good location) |
| 10 machines | ~6-8 months | ~$10K/month |
| 25-30 machines | ~21 months (Kyle) | $35-40K/month |
| 45 locations, 79 machines | ~24 months (Anthony) | $102K/month |

### When to Hire
1. **First stocker:** When you can't do pop-ins anymore because you're too busy stocking
   > "I could no longer do pop-ins and grow the business because I was too busy working IN the business." — Kyle
2. **Multiple part-timers > one full-timer:** Kyle learned this after his only employee quit on the spot — now runs 2 part-timers (soon 3) so if one leaves, he's covered
3. **Warehouse manager:** When you have 15-25+ machines and can't keep up with sales analysis and inventory
   - Kyle promoted a driver who preferred computer work to a warehouse manager role
   - The other driver just loads and goes — doesn't kit or analyze
4. **Ops manager:** Anthony hired one at ~40+ locations
   - Handles: ordering inventory, pop-ins, morning dispatch, sales reports, product optimization
   - Training period: ~1-1.5 months of working together
   - Result: Anthony went from 8-10 hours/week to **2 hours/week** (just daily check-ins)

### Hiring Structure (Scaled Route)
```
Owner (you)
├── Ops Manager (ordering, reporting, pop-ins, dispatching)
├── Warehouse Manager (kitting, sales analysis, inventory)
└── Drivers/Stockers (load vehicle, restock, go)
```

### Key Decision: Get a Warehouse
- Kyle's turning point: Getting a warehouse in the city where his machines are (1 hour from home) and hiring a local stocker
- "That was a game changer... now this really feels like a business"
- Don't have your operation tethered to your house

### Financial Model for Hiring
- Anthony: "I was able to run the numbers of how I was paying myself a salary and build the business financial model of how it would work to eventually bring that person on"
- Don't hire until the numbers support it
- But don't wait too long — the opportunity cost of not being able to sell/do pop-ins because you're stocking is real

### Financing vs. Cash
> "I made a mistake liquidating savings to pay cash for machines. I wish I would have financed those first machines and kept that cash for hiring a stocker or reinvesting." — Anthony

- **Conserve cash for operations** (hiring, inventory, warehouse)
- **Finance machines** — the monthly payment is manageable with revenue
- Don't give yourself a low-paying job by hoarding cash into machines instead of infrastructure

## 💰 Revenue Benchmarks

### Per Machine / Per Location
| Tier | Monthly Revenue | Context |
|------|----------------|---------|
| Bad location | $700-800 | Anthony's first machine, placed for convenience not traffic |
| Average | $1,500-2,000 | Standard single machine |
| Good | $3,000-5,000 | Well-placed machines in qualified locations |
| Great | $5,500-6,500 | Anthony has ~7 locations averaging this |
| Unicorn | $10,000-12,000 | Killer locations — "could change your life" |
| Mega-unicorn | $22,000-25,000 | Shannon's micro market (apartments + condos + long-term hotel) |

### Route-Level Benchmarks
| Operator | Machines | Locations | Monthly Revenue | Timeline |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------|----------|
| Kyle | 25-30 | ~25 | $35-40K | 21 months |
| Anthony | 79 | 45 | $102K | ~24 months |
| Shannon | ~4-6 | 4 | ~$30K+ | 18 months |

### Revenue Math
- **$42,500/month = ~$500K annual revenue** (Kyle was approaching this)
- **Fair Life math:** 6 Fair Life sales/day @ $6 = $60/day × 10 machines = $600/day = **$200K+/year** from just one product
- **Monthly revenue is predictable after 5 months:** Anthony says it's "plus or minus 5% each month after the first 5 months"
- **Weekly payouts** from vending processors — gives flexibility for cash flow management

### Margins
- **Core snacks/drinks:** Penny margin business — volume is key
- **Toilet paper:** ~50%+ margin ($8 cost → $16.99 sell)
- **Protein drinks:** High margin at $7.99 sell price
- **Rebates:** Additional 3-12% back from distributors quarterly

## ❌ Key Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Placing Machines for Convenience, Not Traffic
> "Don't focus on what's convenient for you. Focus on high foot traffic." — Anthony

Anthony's $700/month machine was 5 minutes from his house. His $4,000-5,000/month machines are in properly qualified locations.

### 2. Not Asking Enough Qualifying Questions
- Don't assume shift sizes — ASK specifically
- Don't skip the "do you provide free snacks" question
- Don't forget to check for nearby convenience stores

### 3. Trying to Do Everything Yourself Too Long
> "You can't do $25/hour tasks all the time." — Mike to Anthony early on

- Hire before you think you're ready
- The cost of not doing pop-ins (because you're stocking) far exceeds the cost of a stocker

### 4. Paying Cash for Machines Instead of Financing
- Conserve cash for operations, hiring, and inventory
- Finance the machines — the revenue covers payments

### 5. Buying Variety Packs at Scale
- The waste from unsold flavors makes your effective cost per unit much higher
- Get distributor relationships for single-SKU ordering ASAP

### 6. Only Having One Employee
- When Kyle's only employee quit on the spot (dropped keys at the door), everything fell apart
- Always have backup: 2+ part-timers so one leaving doesn't kill operations

### 7. Not Having a CRM
- With a long sales cycle (10-12 weeks to 6-8 months), you WILL lose leads without one
- Track every pop-in, every follow-up, every contact

### 8. Getting Discouraged by Rejection
- It's a numbers game — 1 in 10 is normal
- The sales cycle is long — results come in waves
- "If you're not out there hustling to get it, somebody else is going to." — Kyle

### 9. Ignoring Competition (or Letting It Intimidate You)
- Kyle had a competitor send him a cease-and-desist letter to try to bully him out
- His response: "Let's go. Game on, buddy." — He went harder
- Don't worry about googling competitors — focus on your own execution

### 10. Not Asking for Referrals
- Every property manager knows other property managers
- Every pop-in should end with: "Do you manage other properties? Know anyone who'd benefit from this?"
- Anthony gets 1-2 referrals/month just from reputation now — stopped actively selling for months
