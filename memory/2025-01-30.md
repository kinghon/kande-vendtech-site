## Kande Photo Booths Dashboard - Email Fix

### Problem
- Gmail/nodemailer email sending was timing out on Railway servers
- Packer submit flow: checklist saved successfully but email failed with "Connection timeout"
- Error seen in Railway logs: `[SUBMIT] Email send failed: Error: Connection timeout`

### Solution: Switched to Resend
- Replaced `nodemailer` with `resend` package in `kande-photo-booths/dashboard/`
- Updated `src/server.js` - `sendChecklistEmail()` function now uses Resend API
- Committed: "Switch email from Gmail/nodemailer to Resend"
- Pushed to GitHub (kande-vendtech-site repo)

### TODO (Kurtis action needed):
1. Sign up at https://resend.com (free tier: 100 emails/day)
2. Get API key (starts with `re_`)
3. Add to Railway Variables: `RESEND_API_KEY` = the key
4. Optional: Add `RESEND_FROM_EMAIL` for custom sender (requires domain verification)
5. Trigger redeploy on Railway

### Notes
- Using `onboarding@resend.dev` as default sender until domain verified
- Resend handles email delivery better from cloud servers (vs Gmail SMTP which gets blocked)
- Railway Variables page was open with `RESEND_API_KEY` field ready to fill
