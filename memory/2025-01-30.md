## 04:04 - Compound Engineering Setup

Kurtis shared Ryan Carson's strategy for making agents learn and ship while you sleep. Implemented for Clawdbot:

**Created:**
- `tasks/backlog.md` - Priority-ordered task list for nightly execution
- `scripts/compound/README.md` - Documentation for the system
- `reports/` directory - For nightly execution reports

**Cron Jobs Added:**
- `compound-review` (10:30 PM) - Reviews sessions, extracts learnings, updates AGENTS.md/MEMORY.md
- `auto-compound` (11:00 PM) - Picks top backlog task, spawns sub-agent to implement, ships

**Updated:**
- `AGENTS.md` - Added Compound Engineering section with full workflow documentation

**Key Insight:** Review runs before auto-compound so fresh learnings feed into that night's implementation. Compounding effect.

**Next:** Kurtis needs to populate `tasks/backlog.md` with real priorities.
