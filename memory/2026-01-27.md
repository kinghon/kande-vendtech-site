# 2026-01-27 - Kande Dashboard Major Build Session

## Project: info.kandedash.com
Staff dashboard for Kande Photo Booths - pulls event data from VSCO Workspace API.

### Deployed to Railway
- **URL**: https://info.kandedash.com
- **Railway Project**: kande-dashboard
- **DNS**: CNAME `info` → `ofzbcoh0.up.railway.app` (Cloudflare, proxy OFF)

### Features Implemented Today

**Mobile Improvements:**
- Collapsible header on mobile (hamburger menu toggle)
- Touch-friendly signature capture

**Checklist System:**
- Inline signature field (not popup) - above DONE button
- Staff name dropdown with "Other" option for custom names
- Subcontractor checkbox + name field (persists across refreshes)
- Email toggle for admin to disable notifications during testing
- Completed tag on checklist buttons when done

**Data Persistence:**
- File-based storage at `data/checklist-data.json`
- Persists: checked items, notes, subcontractor info, submissions
- Note: Resets on redeploy (would need database for permanent storage)

**Contact Fields:**
- Created VSCO custom fields: "primary onsite contact" + "primary onsite contact number"
- Shows Onsite Contact, Backup Contact (always visible, "Not set" if empty)
- Phone numbers are clickable tel: links

**Services Display:**
- Hidden: discounts, extended hours, full day add ons, negative prices
- First service item is expandable with details (backdrop, template, pricing)

**UI Cleanup:**
- Removed event type badges from headers
- Added KANDE logo as favicon and in header
- Fixed timezone to PST for event filtering

### Key Bug Fixes
1. **Done button not working**: Route order issue - `/submit` route must come before `/:itemId` route in Express
2. **Onclick breaking**: Event titles with apostrophes broke JS - switched to data attributes
3. **Subcontractor not persisting**: Data only loaded on checklist expand, not page load
