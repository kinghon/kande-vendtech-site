## Overnight Build Session (1:00 AM - 6:00 AM PST)

### Sales CRM Refinements (with Kurtis)
- Mobile: badges flush left under name
- Route Planner emoji: map → 🚗
- Saved indicator: position absolute (was taking layout space)
- Removed Status and Phone from Property Info (managed via badge cycling and contacts)
- Compact Property Info: 3-column grid
- Contact fields: full-width grid, expanded to show content
- Mobile: single column for Property Info + Contacts
- Mobile: per-field labels on contacts (Name, Role, Phone, Email)
- Contact column titles added (desktop header row)

### AI Office Framework Built
- Based on paper: "If You Want Coherence, Orchestrate a Team of Rivals" (arXiv:2601.14351)
- 6 roles: Planner, Researcher, Builder, Writer, Critic (veto power), Synthesizer
- Skill created at skills/ai-office/ with role templates
- Key principle: errors die in committee, not in front of the user

### Massive Dashboard Build-Out (10 agents, 5 teams)
Kurtis said "spend 6 hours building out vend.kandedash.com" and "surprise me"

**Teams deployed:**
- 🎯 Strategy: Atlas + Sage → Competitive analysis + go-to-market strategy
- 🏗️ Framework: Nova + Cipher → AI Office page, APIs, global nav, route optimization, marketing/SEO
- 👥 People: Forge + Ivy → Staff Management + Client CRM
- 📊 Analytics: Scout + Pixel → Product Performance + Planogram Editor
- 🔍 Quality: Raven (QA) + Jarvis (coordinator)

**New pages deployed:**
1. `/machines` — Machine & Location Tracker
2. `/inventory` — Product Catalog (35 pre-loaded products)
3. `/finance` — Financial Dashboard with P&L, credit card tracker
4. `/restock` — 6-stage restock workflow
5. `/strategy` — Full competitive analysis + go-to-market (530-780 TAM properties in LV)
6. `/staff` — Employee roster, shift tracking, scheduling
7. `/clients` — Client CRM with health scores, issue tracker, touchpoints
8. `/performance` — Product performance analytics, margin analysis
9. `/planogram` — Visual slot editor with drag-and-drop, zone highlighting
10. `/ai-office` — AI Office dashboard with architecture diagram
11. `/kanban` — Live task board tracking all 10 agents
12. Enhanced `/map` — Multi-stop route optimization, service radius, revenue tiers
13. Enhanced `/seo` — GBP metrics, lead sources, marketing spend, ROI tracker
14. `nav.js` — Global navigation component (15 pages, mobile hamburger)

**Key strategy finding:** No LV operator combines AI smart vending + apartment focus + $54 rent premium pitch. That's Kande's white space. TAM: 530-780 properties.

### Kurtis Q&A
- Asked about API costs with more agents → explained tradeoff (speed/quality vs cost, ~$5-15 for tonight's build)
- Requested 10 agents with 2 per team, all named, tracked on kanban

### Morning Session (11:18 AM onwards)
- Kurtis woke up ~11:18 AM (slept ~5.5 hours)
- Gateway was disconnected — LaunchAgent wasn't loaded. Installed as persistent service: `clawdbot gateway install`
- Removed global nav (nav.js) from CRM + Route Planner — sales-facing pages shouldn't expose ops pages to sales team
- Removed service radius feature from map (Kurtis didn't want it)
- Removed revenue tier legend from map
- Updated map legend to show all statuses: Hot, Warm, New, Signed, Stale, Needs Action
- Map markers turn green when added to route planner
- Fixed map crash: leftover `drawServiceRadius()` call after function was removed caused "Failed to load data" error

### Lessons Learned
- When removing a feature, grep for ALL references (function calls, variables, HTML elements) — don't just delete the function and UI
- Sales-facing pages (CRM, Route Planner) should NOT have global nav exposing internal ops tools
- Browser cache causes confusion on mobile — remind user to hard refresh after deploys
- `clawdbot gateway install` is needed for persistence — don't assume it's already configured
