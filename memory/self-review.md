# Self-Review Log

Metacognitive loop: question assumptions, log misses, reinforce wins.

**Tags:** `confidence` | `uncertainty` | `speed` | `depth`

**Entry types:**
- `MISS` / `FIX` — what went wrong, how to catch it
- `HIT` / `WHY` — what worked, why it worked (reinforce)

TAG: confidence
MISS: (none yet - system just initialized)
FIX: start logging as patterns emerge

TAG: depth
HIT: mid-session capture added to compound engineering
WHY: Kurtis suggested it → recognized gap immediately → implemented. Listening > assuming.

---

*On boot: read recent entries. Reinforce HITs, counter-check MISSes when context overlaps.*
